#Theamus
Theamus is a content management system (CMS) that is geared towards developers. The whole point of this project is to make everything on your website seem like it's all a part of the same website.

You've seen what I'm talking about. When you go to a website and it looks nice, but then they have a blog with a different stylesheet and then a forum with yet a different styling again. They all kind of follow the same pattern of style, but it's noticeably different.

Theamus is intended to make everything look like it was specifically designed for your website even though it's modular, but it's more than plugins that allow you to do this. It's _features_ of your website. Complicated or not, they're dedicated to being a feature, and not just an addition to a page.

##Installation
1. Drop the files into a web root somewhere and go to that location in your browser
2. Make sure all of your prerequisites are good to go
3. Follow the instructions of the installer! 

> __Note__  
> You will have to have created a database before you run the installer.

>__Whoops__  
>There's currently a missing prereq check for the php5mcrypt extension. It's required so make sure you have it!

##Everything Else
I've been trying to document everything as much as I can. I have some stuff scattered everywhere, but I've been putting most of the documentation in the [`documentation` folder](https://github.com/helllomatt/Theamus/tree/master/documentation) at the root of the repo. There's not enough to know how to create features or themes right now, but it's coming Soon<sup>TM</sup>.
