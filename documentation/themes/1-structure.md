# Theme Structure

There's one file that's required for a theme to be valid. Obviously that's the bare minimum since the contents of the file need to be valid, too.

```
theme-folder
|-config.json
```

That's all you need for the theme to be valid. However you feel like naming your folders to hold all of your resources and libraries is up to you.

I usually go with something like:
```
theme-folder
|-css
 |-default.css
|-index.php
|-config.json
```
