# Theamus Theme Introduction

Themes are what your website are. They tell you apart from all of the other websites out there, and Theamus doesn't inhibit you from doing what you want to do. At the start of Theamus, the idea was to make a bunch of different projects look the same. Themes were close in mind when carrying out the whole project.

There's no limit to what you can do with themes, and as Theamus grows, so does the ability to have more dynamic websites. Especially now that you can call any page and get it's contents as JSON, themes have never been more powerful.

I won't tell you what you can or can't do. That's not why I'm here. Theamus has no restrictions on what you decide to use for your front end. Make beautiful things, easily.
