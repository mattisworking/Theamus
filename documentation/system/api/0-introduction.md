# Theamus API Introduction
Theamus uses a sort of API to talk to the front end of your feature. I say sort of because it's not really something you can use on any other website to talk to a Theamus website. It's an API, sure, but it's tied into Theamus heavily.

By heavily, I mean it sends a lot of Theamus-related information along with the API request to make sure you are who you say you are.

## Example
