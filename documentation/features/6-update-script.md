# Running an Update Script

Maybe somewhere down the line you feel that your feature needs to modify it's existing tables, add new ones, remove old ones, or even clean up some files. Any way you do it, it makes sense to do these things when the user updates their feature.

Running the update script is similar to running the install script. You modify the configuration file to point at the script, then when the time comes, it runs.

The `config.php` file would look something like this:

```php
<?php

$Theamus->Call->set_feature_config(array(
    // System Required
    ...

    // Feature Required
    ...

    // Feature Optional
    ...
    "configuration_scripts" => array(
        ...
        "update" => array("config/update.php"),
    ),

    // Optional Author Information
    ...
));
```

Now, when your feature is being update, it will load the `great_calc/config/file.php` file. Next, you need to get the file  to run something so there's a specifically named function that will run, if you have it defined. It's so simply named `update()`.

`config/update.php` would look something like this:

```php
<?php

function update($Theamus, $prefix) {
    // you have the entire Theamus class, and the generated table prefix to use for installing tables
}
```

The first parameter is going to be the Theamus class, so you can use all of it if you want to. Most likely you'll be looking for the `$Theamus->DB` class. The `$prefix` parameter is a database table prefix that is unique to your feature. This is generated by Theamus and will be how Theamus looks for your feature's tables. Obviously, you don't need the prefix if you want your tables to stay forever, but it's reccomended you include it into your table names.
